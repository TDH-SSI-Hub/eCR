# eICR Parser

This is a repository for eICR parser programs used to parse data from eICR files. This is a bit rough and will need some adaptation to elsewhere.

## [eICRMissingDatadashGrabber.py](eICRMissingDatadashGrabber.py)
This file is for daily grabbing of yesterday's data.

## [eICRMissingDataDashGrabberBackfiller2.py](eICRMissingDataDashGrabberBackfiller2.py)
This file is for backfilling data and dates need to be manually supplied.
